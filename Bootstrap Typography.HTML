            You may write me down in history
            With your bitter, twisted lies,
            You may trod me in the very dirt
            But still, like dust, I'll rise.
            
            Does my sassiness upset you?
            Why are you beset with gloom?
            â€™Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
            Pumping in my living room.
